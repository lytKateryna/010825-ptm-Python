  /home/su/DjangoProjects/jr_project_db/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/django/db/backends/postgresql/base.py:512: RuntimeWarning: Normally Django will use a connection to the 'postgres' database to avoid running initialization queries against the production database when it's not needed (for example, when running tests). Django was unable to create a connection to the 'postgres' database and will use the first PostgreSQL database instead.
